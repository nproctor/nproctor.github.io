USGS Water Services data is combined with leaflet mapping packages to display real time data of 
stream flow for rivers across the country. Along with instantaneous values, this website allows users to access details for each sensor location. The detailed data shows the stream flow values since midnight, the current streamflow percentile based on the historical data of the current day, and the median stream flow value for every calendar day.
